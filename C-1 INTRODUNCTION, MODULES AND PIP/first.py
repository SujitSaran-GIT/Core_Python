# modules
# modules is a file, containing code, written by somebody else (usually) ,which can be imported and used in our program
# Python modules are files containing Python code that define functions, classes, and variables that can be reused in other Python programs. Modules help organize code into manageable sections and promote reusability. 
# In Python, modules are a key way to organize and reuse code. They come in several types, each serving a different purpose.Here are different types of modules in Python:

#1. Built-in Modules
#Python comes with several built-in modules that you can use without installing anything. Some examples include:
#Definition: These are modules that are included with the Python standard library and come pre-installed with Python.

#math: Provides mathematical functions like sin(), cos(), sqrt(), etc.
#os: Provides a way to interact with the operating system, including file and directory handling.
#sys: Provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter and functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
#datetime: Supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.
#random: Implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions.

#2. Third-Party Modules
#These are modules created by other developers and not included with Python by default. They can be installed using pip.
# Definition: These are modules created by the Python community and are not included in the standard library. They can be installed via package managers like pip.
# Examples include:

#requests: A popular library for making HTTP requests.
#numpy: A powerful library for numerical computing in Python.
#pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
#matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
#flask: A micro web framework for building web applications.

#3. Custom Modules
#These are modules you create yourself. 
# For example, if you write a Python script named mymodule.py, you can import it into other scripts like this:
# Definition: These are user-defined modules created by writing Python code in a .py file. They can be imported and used in other Python scripts.
# Example
#import mymodule
# mymodule.py
#def greet(name):
#   return f"Hello, {name}!"

#another_script.py
# another_script.py
#import mymodule
#print(mymodule.greet("Alice"))

#4. Package Modules
#A package is a collection of Python modules grouped together within a directory hierarchy. It allows you to structure your Python application into multiple modules. A package typically includes an __init__.py file to indicate that the directory is a package. 
# Definition: A package is a collection of modules organized in a directory hierarchy. A package usually contains an __init__.py file that initializes the package.
# For example:

#scikit-learn: A machine learning library that is organized into multiple modules and sub-packages.
#django: A high-level Python web framework organized into many packages and modules.

#Example Usage:
#import math  # Importing the math module
#result = math.sqrt(25)
#print(result)  # Output: 5.0
#Modules are a fundamental part of Python programming, helping keep code organized, modular, and reusable.

# Example
#import pyjokes
#joke=pyjokes.get_joke()
#print(joke)

# 5. Compiled Python Modules
#Definition: These are modules written in languages like C or C++ that have been compiled to shared libraries or dynamic link libraries (DLLs) and can be imported into Python.
#Examples:
#The numpy module has parts that are implemented in C for performance reasons.
#Pythonâ€™s built-in time module is partially implemented in C.

#6. C Extension Modules
#Definition: These modules are written in C or C++ and extend Python with compiled code. They are typically used to improve performance or interface with C libraries.
#Examples:
#ctypes: Provides C-compatible data types and allows calling functions in DLLs or shared libraries.

#7. Namespace Packages
#Definition: These are packages that do not contain an __init__.py file. Instead, they allow for the distribution of different parts of the package across multiple directories.
#Examples:
#Python 3 supports namespace packages, which can be spread across multiple directories, making it easier to organize large projects.

#8. Dynamic Modules
#Definition: These are modules that are generated dynamically at runtime, often using built-in functions or tools like importlib.
#Examples:
#Modules loaded dynamically using importlib.import_module().
#These different types of modules allow Python to be a flexible and powerful programming language, suitable for a wide range of applications.

# pip
#The full form of "pip" is "Pip Installs Packages." It is the package installer for Python, allowing you to install and manage additional libraries and dependencies that are not part of the Python standard library.
# Example
# pip install flask

5. Why Use Packages?
Organization: Packages allow you to organize your code into modules, making it easier to manage and navigate, especially in larger projects.
Namespace Management: By grouping related modules into packages, you avoid name clashes and manage your codebase better.
Reusability: Packages enable you to create reusable code that can be easily imported and used in multiple projects.
