    for i in range(1,11):
    ------------------------
    The line of code for i in range(1, 11): is part of a for loop in Python. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. The for Loop
The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code multiple times.
2. range(1, 11)
range(): This function generates a sequence of numbers.
range(1, 11): Specifically, this creates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to (but not including) 11.
The first argument 1 is the starting point (inclusive).
The second argument 11 is the stopping point (exclusive), meaning the sequence will include numbers from 1 to 10.
So, range(1, 11) generates the sequence: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
3. i
i: This is a loop variable that takes on each value in the sequence generated by range(1, 11).
In the first iteration, i is 1, in the second iteration, i is 2, and so on, up to 10.
4. Colon :
The colon : at the end of the line indicates that what follows is a block of code that will be executed for each value of i in the loop.
Example Usage
Here’s how you might use it in a full loop:

python
Copy code
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
What Happens Here?
The loop runs 10 times.
In each iteration, i takes on the value of the current number in the sequence [1, 2, 3, ..., 10].
The print(i) statement prints the current value of i.
Output:

Copy code
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
Summary
for i in range(1, 11): creates a loop that iterates over the numbers from 1 to 10.
Each time the loop runs, the variable i takes the next value in the sequence, and you can use i within the loop to perform various operations.

    print(f"5*{i}={5*i}")
    ------------------------
    The line of code print(f"5 x {i} = {5 * i}") is used to print a formatted string that shows the multiplication of 5 with a variable i. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. print() Function
The print() function is used to output text to the console.
Everything inside the parentheses () will be displayed as output.
2. Formatted String (f-string)
f"...": This is a formatted string literal in Python, commonly referred to as an f-string.
F-strings allow you to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces {}. The expressions inside the curly braces are evaluated at runtime, and their results are inserted into the string.
3. The String Content
"5 x {i} = {5 * i}": This is the string template inside the f-string.
5 x: This is a static part of the string, meaning it will always display as "5 x" in the output.
4. {i}
The expression {i} inside the curly braces refers to the value of the variable i.
Whatever value i holds during the current iteration of the loop will be inserted here.
5. {5 * i}
The expression {5 * i} inside the curly braces performs the multiplication of 5 and i.
The result of this multiplication will be inserted into the string at this position.
Example of Usage in a Loop
Here’s how the line might be used within a loop:

python
Copy code
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"5 x {i} = {5 * i}")
What Happens Here?
Suppose i is 2 during the loop iteration:
The expression inside the f-string would be evaluated as 5 x 2 = 10.
The print function outputs: 5 x 2 = 10.
This process repeats for every value of i in the loop (from 1 to 10).
Example Output
Running the loop would produce the following output:

Copy code
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45
5 x 10 = 50
Summary
print(f"5 x {i} = {5 * i}") uses an f-string to dynamically create and print a multiplication statement for the current value of i.
It inserts the value of i and the result of 5 * i into the string at the appropriate places, producing a formatted multiplication table.
