# Explanation this code
"""
1. Importing the Library
python
Copy code
import pyttsx3
pyttsx3: This is a Python library that allows you to convert text to speech. It works offline and is platform-independent, meaning it works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

2. Initializing the Text-to-Speech Engine
python
Copy code
engine = pyttsx3.init()
pyttsx3.init(): This function initializes the text-to-speech engine and returns an engine object that you can use to control the speech properties (like voice, rate, volume, etc.).
engine: This variable holds the initialized text-to-speech engine.

3. Queueing the First Speech Command
python
Copy code
engine.say("Hello Mr. Sambit, what are you doing")
engine.say(text): This method adds the text "Hello Mr. Sambit, what are you doing" to the speech queue. The engine will speak this text when it is run.
Text: The text you want to convert to speech. The engine will pronounce this text.

4. Queueing the Second Speech Command
python
Copy code
engine.say("Please sir, I want to fuck you")
Similar to the previous say command, this adds the text "Please sir, I want to fuck you" to the speech queue. The engine will speak this text immediately after finishing the previous one.

5. Running the Speech Engine
python
Copy code
engine.runAndWait()
engine.runAndWait(): This command starts the speech synthesis. It processes the speech queue (which contains the text added by say() commands) and speaks it out loud.
Blocking: The runAndWait() function blocks the program from continuing until all the queued text has been spoken.
Overall Explanation
The script first imports the pyttsx3 library and initializes a text-to-speech engine.
It then queues two different phrases to be spoken out loud, one after the other.
Finally, it runs the engine, causing the queued text to be spoken.
Important Note:
The second phrase in this script contains explicit content. This might be inappropriate or offensive depending on the context in which the script is used. Be mindful of the content you include in text-to-speech applications, especially if they are used in public or professional settings.
